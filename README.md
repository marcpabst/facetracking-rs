# facetracking-rs // Facetracking in Rust

`facetracking-rs` is a Rust library that provides a high-level API for face detection and tracking. It uses `onnxruntime` through the `ort` crate to run deep learning models. 

:construction: This is very much a work in progress. :construction:

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> On macOS, this currently needs to be compiled using Rust nightly. This is due to the usage of unstable standard library features in a workaround.
