# üë© facetracking-rs
**Fast and accurate facetracking in Rust.**

[![build](https://github.com/marcpabst/facetracking-rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marcpabst/facetracking-rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml)


`facetracking-rs` is a Rust library that provides a high-level API for face detection and tracking. It uses `onnxruntime` through the `ort` crate to run deep learning models. 

> [!WARNING] 
>  This is very much a work in progress. Use with care!

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> On macOS, this currently needs to be compiled using Rust nightly. This is due to the usage of unstable standard library features.
